## Executive Summary

This architecture represents a **language learning platform** that leverages **Generative AI (GenAI)** capabilities for sentence construction, vocabulary building, and immersive learning activities. The system is modular and scalable, comprising three main components:

1. **Frontend Language Portal**: Interface for students and teachers.
2. **Backend API**: Manages vector operations, activity tracking, and GenAI interactions.
3. **GenAI Systems**: Powers sentence construction, context-based learning responses, and natural language understanding.

## Data Strategy

### Data Types

**Structured Data:**
- User profiles (students/teachers)
- Vocabulary database
- Progress tracking data
- Vector embeddings

**Unstructured Data:**
- Knowledge base content
- AI-generated responses
- Sample sentence constructions

### Data Flow

1. **Input Processing:**
   - The student initiates a sentence construction activity by providing an English sentence.
   - Backend API processes the input, fetches related data from the SQL database, and triggers an LLM request.
   - The LLM provides contextual hints, vocabulary suggestions, and example sentences.
   - The student's response is validated with additional clues provided as needed.
   - Complexity of subsequent sentences increases dynamically based on user performance.

2. **Storage:**
   - SQL database for persistent storage.
   - Vector database for fast retrieval.
   - Cache layer for frequently accessed data.
